# Bandit 20

At this level, I was a little overwhealed. I got to learn that since I had permission to execute bandit20-do as a bandit19 user, it means, I could use it to access the files in the /etc/bandit_pass directory.

I used `./bandit20-do ls /etc/bandit_pass/` to list the items and `/bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20` to display the password's content.

The password for bandit 20 is 0qXahG8ZjOVMN9Ghs7iOWsCfZyXOUbYO
