# Bandit 15
First, I have to extract the password for bandit 14 from `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14`. So I used the cat command for that. 
So the password is MU4VWeTyJk8ROof1qqmcBPaLh7lDCPvS

Secondly, I had to submit password to the localhost on port 30000. I did this using the nc command. 
So the password for bandit15 is 8xCjnmgoKbGLhHFAZlGE5Tmu4M2tKJQo
