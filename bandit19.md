# Bandit 19

Anytime I logged into bandit18, I got logged out. But like the hint suggested, I can access the password to bandit 19 in the home directory. 

This made me learn how to execute a command through SSH wihtout actually staying logged in. 

I finally used `ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "cat ~/readme"`

The password was cGWpMaKXVwDUNgPAVJbWYuGHVn9zl3j8
